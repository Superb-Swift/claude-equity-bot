# WS1 Deploy Notes — Triple Blend (shadow-parallel, era A-S1D1-B1)

*Claude Equity Bot · Phase 3-B WS1 · 2026-07-10 · build base: repo @ `cb79987`. Implements `WS1\\\_Implementation\\\_Spec.md` with rulings DP-W1 (all three components) + DP-W2 (0.15/0.15). Advisory-only · no orders · not financial advice.*

## 2 · The design in one paragraph

The blend runs **shadow-parallel**: the base signal stays the official advisory output (`confidence` = D1(raw), unchanged), while the blend is computed on the model's raw confidence, damped through the **same** D1, and written to `confidence\\\_blend` — logged and measured for G2 but **not driving the risk gate**. Three confidence channels now ride every line: `confidence\\\_raw` (model) → `confidence` (base op, official) and, in parallel, `confidence\\\_blend` (blend op, candidate). The blend lives **entirely in the logs** — **no tracker schema change**, so `h1\\\_lag\\\_trace` / `t2\\\_check` / the formulas are untouched. Trend scopes stay disjoint: C2 = sector, C3 = market, D1 = ticker — no double-counting.

## 3 · Parameters \& conventions

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|Components|C2 sector-backbone + C3 cross-asset-regime (DP-W1)|
|Weights|sector 0.15 / regime 0.15 (DP-W2; fixed, pre-registered, **unfitted**)|
|Windows / scales|20-day trend, 10% = full ±1.0 (both C2 and C3)|
|Regime proxy|SPY − GLD (DP-W7; both on the watchlist)|
|HOLD|overlays leave HOLD confidence unchanged (DP-W3)|
|FLOOR|35 (matches D1)|
|Era stamp|`A-S1D1-B1` (single live arm, not an A/B)|
|Log tag|`B\\\[sec=…; reg=…; w=0.15/0.15; base=<raw>; blend=<pure>; blend\\\_op=<blend after D1>]`|
|JSON fields|`confidence\\\_blend`, `sector\\\_score`, `regime\\\_score`|
|Fetch load|\~7 incremental price pulls/run (unique sector ETFs; XLU/SPY/GLD already fetched)|

## 4 · Test evidence (sandbox)

|#|Test|Result|
|-|-|-|
|T1|Base D1 path vs the **original** `apply\\\_conf\\\_damping`, 4000 random cases|**4000/4000 identical** (confidence, confidence\_raw, damp)|
|T2|Blend math table — direction integrity, confirm/oppose symmetry, HOLD untouched, floor 35, parse-error|PASS|
|T3|C2 clips at ±1; C3 = SPY−GLD gap; broad/commodity → neutral; unknown → neutral + flag|PASS|
|T4|End-to-end arithmetic (confirm +24%, oppose −19.5%)|PASS|
|T5|Integration: registry → `run\\\_blend\\\_scores` → `blend\\\_confidence` → dual D1 → `B\\\[…]` tag → JSON parses|PASS|
|T6|`parse\\\_log\\\_to\\\_tracker` output byte-identical to original; tracker gets **base** operative; blend stays in log|PASS|

## 5 · Deploy runbook

1. Add the 4 new files + replace `main.py` / `risk\\\_engine.py` (`git diff --stat` matches §1).
2. **PM diagnostic smoke** (PM = diagnostic-only): `python main.py`, then verify — banner `A-S1D1-B1`; log line `"\\\[WS1] blend context: N sector ETF(s), regime \\\['GLD','SPY'] loaded"` (\~7 ETFs); every signal line carries `B\\\[…]` + `confidence\\\_blend`/`sector\\\_score`/`regime\\\_score` in the JSON; a hand spot-check (a tech BUY with its XLK up + risk-on → `blend > raw`; the same with XLK down → `blend < raw`); **base `Conf %` unchanged** in the paste file (shadow-parallel intact); `analyze\\\_log` + `parse\\\_log\\\_to\\\_tracker` still 24/24.
3. **Re-seed S1 state** after the PM run (unchanged discipline).
4. Go live next AM. Daily flow unchanged; the blend accrues silently in the logs.

## 6 · Acceptance — Gate G2

Blend deployed shadow-parallel; **≥ N=5** blended cohorts +5d-resolved; blend **no-worse** than base on +5d accuracy **and** magnitude, cross-validated (leave-one-cohort-out — no single cohort carries it); T3 throughout. Read from the logs: `confidence\\\_blend` per cohort joined to the tracker's +5d resolutions by date+ticker (a small reader, like the raw-channel `h1\\\_lag\\\_trace --raw-from-logs`, to be added). → **VERDICT** adopt (flip the gate to the blend — one line) / reject-and-retain-base, or **DESCOPE**.

## 7 · Open items

* **Blend evaluation reader** — the log→+5d base-vs-blend comparator (not built here; the G2 measurement tool, analogous to the raw-channel acceptance read).
* **WS3 + EDGAR** — register into `context\\\_providers` as prompt providers (see the EDGAR scope spec); `run\\\_prompt\\\_context` is the wired hook.
* Optional: retrofit `news\\\_client` into the registry as the reference prompt provider.
